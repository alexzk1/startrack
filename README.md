This project aims couple things:
1. Figure what and how arduino is.
2. FIX stupid child C/C++ mixes  met into arduino libs (believe or not, C++ templates has less bytes compiled then pure C).
3. I need alt/azimuth tracker for the telescope for the Dobson mount.
4. Very good if it will automatically show target in stellarium.

What is done:
1. It tracks. Connected to telescope, pointed to Polar Star,then MOVED 
with alltogether to the other room, and this device keeps tracking of 
what and where I see.
